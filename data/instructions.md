# Instructions on how to retrieve data

I'm not authorized to share the data, but if you are a student/data scientisti/ecc. you can request access to the SEER database [here](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html) and perform queries through SEERStat.

This is the only way to obtain data from SEER. Don't worry, SEERStat has a quite nice user interface, you can find instructions [here](https://seer.cancer.gov/data/access.html)
